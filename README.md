Samsung's One UI 8.0 update has removed the option to [unlock the bootloader](https://xdaforums.com/t/bootloader-unlocking-option-removed-from-one-ui-8-0.4751904), restricting user freedom and device customization.

This project aims to help users reclaim control over their Samsung devices. If you're on One UI 7.0 or earlier **and your region allows bootloader unlocking**, you can still root your device and enjoy true ownership.

## Shady Practices

Samsung has taken several controversial steps to restrict user freedom:

- Knox Warranty Bit tripping: Rooting your device **WILL** trip your Knox Warranty Bit, this action is not reversible in any way.
- Bootloader cannot be unlocked in Newer Versions: Users cannot unlock the bootloader starting from Samsung One UI 8.0.
- No VoLTE on Custom ROMs: Samsung's IMS service is not compatible with AOSP's, so VoLTE will not work on GSI ROMs.
- Camera disabling: In the past, Samsung disabled cameras on devices with unlocked bootloaders.

## Our Mission

We believe users should have the right to fully control and customize their devices. If you share this vision, join us in fighting back against anti-consumer restrictions.
