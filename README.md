Samsung's One UI 8.0 update has removed the option to [unlock the bootloader](https://xdaforums.com/t/bootloader-unlocking-option-removed-from-one-ui-8-0.4751904), restricting user freedom and device customization.

This project aims to help users reclaim control over their Samsung devices. If you're on One UI 7.0 or earlier **and your region allows bootloader unlocking**, you can still root your device and enjoy true ownership.

## Shady Practices

Samsung has taken several controversial steps to restrict user freedom:

- **Knox tripping:** Rooting your device permanently disables certain features.
- **Bootloader cannot be unlocked in One UI 8.0:** Users cannot unlock the bootloader on newer versions.
- **Camera disabling:** In the past, Samsung disabled cameras on devices with unlocked bootloaders.

  - [Case 2: Galaxy S22 cameras](https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-bootloader-unlock-camera-working)

## Our Mission

We believe users should have the right to fully control and customize their devices. If you share this vision, join us in fighting back against anti-consumer restrictions.
